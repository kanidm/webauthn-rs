FIDO Metadata Service Parser
============================

The FIDO Alliance organisation publishes a "metadata" blob, similar to a certificate
transparency report, that lists the status of and trust chains of authenticator
devices that have passed their certifications.

This tool allows querying that metadata blob for a human to inspect the properties
of devices and their certification status.
