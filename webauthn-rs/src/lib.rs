//! Webauthn-rs - Webauthn for Rust Server Applications
//!
//! Webauthn is a standard allowing communication between servers, browsers and authenticators
//! to allow strong, passwordless, cryptographic authentication to be performed. Webauthn
//! is able to operate with many authenticator types, such as U2F.
//!
//! This library aims to provide a secure Webauthn implementation that you can
//! plug into your application, so that you can provide Webauthn to your users.
//!
//! For examples, see our examples folder.
//!
//! To use this library yourself, you will want to reference the `WebauthnConfig` trait to
//! develop site specific policy and configuration, and the `Webauthn` struct for Webauthn
//! interactions.
