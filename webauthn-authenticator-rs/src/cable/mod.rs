//! caBLE / Hybrid Authenticator
//!
//! **tl;dr:** scan a QR code with a `FIDO:/` URL, mobile device sends a BTLE
//! advertisement, this is used to establish a doubly-encrypted (TLS and
//! [Noise][]) Websocket tunnel over which the platform can send a single CTAP
//! 2.x command and get a response.
//!
//! This module implements both the [initator][connect_cable_authenticator] and
//! [authenticator][share_cable_authenticator] side of caBLE, provided
//! [you have appropriate hardware](#requirements).
//!
//! The initiator implementation provides a [`CtapAuthenticator`][] (so works
//! like other authenticator backends), and uses a [`UiCallback`][]
//! implementation to display the QR code the user. Authenticators on Android
//! and iOS only allow the initiator to send a single command before hanging up,
//! so other features like credential management won't work.
//!
//! The authenticator implementation takes an input URL (parsed from the QR
//! code), a [`AuthenticatorBackendHashedClientData`] and an [`Advertiser`] to
//! establish a tunnel and respond to an initator's request. This allows one to
//! share many of the authenticator backends this library already supports over
//! a caBLE tunnel.
//!
//! ## Warning
//!
//! **This implementation is incomplete, and has not been reviewed from a
//! cryptography standpoint.**
//!
//! There is **no** publicly-published spec from this protocol, aside from
//! [Chromium's C++ implementation][crcable], so this aims to do whatever
//! Chromium does.
//!
//! We've attempted to document and untangle things as best we can, but there
//! are probably errors in this implementation and its documentation. caBLE's
//! design appears to have changed multiple times during its development, aiming
//! for compatibility with older versions of Chromium.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! There are two major versions of caBLE, and this only implements caBLE v2.
//! There are also several minor versions of caBLE v2, which aren't fully
//! explained (or implemented here); this mostly implements what we *think* is
//! caBLE v2.1 as both an initiator and an authenticator.
//!
//! Known-missing functionality includes:
//!
//! * caBLE v1: protocol is significantly different
//! * caBLE v2.0: this has some quirks that this doesn't fully implement
//! * [caBLE over AOA][cableaoa] (Android Open Accessory Protocol)
//! * [caBLE over Firebase Cloud Messaging][cablefcm]
//! * Pairing (aka: "contact lists", "remember this computer")
//!
//! It is impossible to know for certain how many gaps there are until the caBLE
//! working group publishes documentation *publicly*.
//!
//! The library is complete enough as an initiator to communicate with
//! authenticators on Android and iOS 16, and complete enough as an
//! authenticator to work with Chrome and Safari as initiators.
//!
//! ## Requirements
//!
//! The initator (or "browser") requires:
//!
//! * a Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) adaptor
//!
//! * an internet connection
//!
//! The authenticator (mobile device) requires:
//!
//! * a caBLE implementation, such as:
//!
//!   * [Android 7 or later][android-ver] with
//!     [a recent version of Chrome and Google Play Services (October 2022)][android]
//!
//!   * [iOS 16 or later][ios][^ios15]
//!
//! * a Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) radio which can transmit service data
//!   advertisements
//!
//! * a camera and QR code scanner[^qr]
//!
//! * an internet connection
//!
//! **On Android,** Chrome handles the `FIDO:/` URL and establishes the
//! Websocket tunnel, and proxies commands to
//! [Google Play's FIDO2 API][gpfido2]. The authenticator
//! [is stored in Google Password Manager][android-sec], and it also supports
//! [devicePubKey][] to attest a specific device's identity.
//!
//! **On iOS,** the authenticator is stored in the iCloud Keychain and shared
//! with all devices signed in to that iCloud account. There is no way to
//! identify *which* device was used.
//!
//! In both cases, the credential is cached in the device's secure element, and
//! requires user verification (lock screen pattern, PIN, password or biometric
//! authentication) to access. This user verification is performed on-device,
//! and is entirely separate to CTAP2's PIN/UV auth.
//!
//! [^ios15]: iOS 15 will recognise caBLE QR codes and offer to authenticate,
//! but this version of the protocol is not supported.
//!
//! ## Protocol overview
//!
//! Entities in a caBLE transaction:
//!
//! * The _initator_ (typically a web browser) starts the caBLE session for a
//!   `MakeCredential` or `GetAssertion` request on behalf of a relying party.
//!
//! * The _authenticator_ (or mobile device) stores credential(s) for the user
//!   in a secure fashion, with some sort of local authentication.
//!
//! * The _tunnel server_ provides a two-way channel for the initator and
//!   authenticator to communicate over WebSockets. There are well-known servers
//!   operated by Apple (`wss://cable.auth.com`) and Google
//!   (`wss://cable.ua5v.com`), and an algorithm to generate tunnel server
//!   domain names from a hash to allow for future expansion.
//!
//! The user attempts to register or sign in using WebAuthn, and chooses to use
//! caBLE ("create a passkey on another device", "save a passkey on a device
//! with a camera"). This application becomes the _initator_ of the caBLE
//! session.
//!
//! The initator generates a CBOR message ([HandshakeV2][]) containing the
//! desired transaction type (`MakeCredential` or `GetAssertion`),
//! [a shared secret][qr-secret] and some protocol version information. It
//! encodes the message as a `FIDO:/` URL by encoding the CBOR as [base10], and
//! then displays it as a QR code for the user to scan with their authenticator.
//!
//! The user scans this QR code using their authenticator (mobile device), which
//! deserialises the [HandshakeV2][] message.
//!
//! Both the initiator and authenticator
//! [derive the tunnel ID][discovery::Discovery::derive_tunnel_id] from the QR
//! code's [shared secret][qr-secret].
//!
//! The authenticator establishes a connection to
//! [a well-known WebSocket tunnel server][tunnel::get_domain] of *its*
//! choosing. Once established, the tunnel server provides a routing ID, which
//! allows the initiator to connect to this session.
//!
//! The authenticator takes [the routing ID][routing_id],
//! [tunnel server ID][tunnel_server_id], and
//! [a nonce of its choosing][nonce] (not shared with the tunnel server) into an
//! [Eid][], and then encrypts and signs it using a secret derived from the QR
//! code's [shared secret][qr-secret]. It then broadcasts this encrypted [Eid][]
//! as a BTLE service data advertisement.
//!
//! Meanwhile, the initiator scans for caBLE BTLE service data advertisements,
//! and [tries to decrypt and parse them][discovery::Discovery::decrypt_advert].
//! On success, it can then find which
//! [tunnel server to connect to][tunnel_server_id], the
//! [routing ID][routing_id], and [the nonce][nonce].
//!
//! Both the initator and the authenticator
//! [derive a pre-shared key][discovery::Discovery::derive_psk] from the
//! [shared secret][qr-secret] and [nonce][].
//!
//! The initator connects to the tunnel server, and starts a handshake with the
//! authenticator using a non-standard version of the [Noise protocol][Noise]
//! ([CableNoise][]), using the pre-shared key and a new
//! ephemeral session key.
//!
//! They use the [CableNoise][] to derive traffic keys for [Crypter][]. All
//! further communications between the initiator and authenticator occur over
//! the [Crypter][] channel.
//!
//! The authenticator immediately sends a [GetInfoResponse][], and will also
//! send a pairing payload once the user has accepted or refused consent[^pair].
//!
//! The initiator can then send a *single* `MakeCredential` or `GetAssertion`
//! command to the authenticator in CTAP 2.0 format. This request *does not* use
//! PIN/UV auth â€“ user verification is handled internally by the authenticator
//! *outside* the CTAP 2.0 protocol[^uv].
//!
//! Once the command is sent, the authenticator will prompt the user to approve
//! the request in a user-verifying way (biometric or lock screen pattern,
//! password or PIN), showing the user and relying party name.
//!
//! Once approved or rejected, the authenticator returns the response to the
//! command, and then closes the Websocket channel. A new handshake must be
//! performed if the user wishes to perform another transaction.
//!
//! The initiator then sends the authenticator's response to the relying party
//! using the usual WebAuthn APIs.
