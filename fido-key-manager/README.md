# fido-key-manager

`fido-key-manager` is a command line tool for managing and configuring FIDO/CTAP
2-compatible authenticators (security keys), based on
[the kanidm webauthn-authenticator-rs library][0].

**Important:** FIDO 1-only (U2F) tokens are **not supported** by this tool.

## Building and running

First, you'll need to [install OpenSSL's headers and libraries](../OpenSSL.md).

On [Linux](#linux) and [macOS](#macos):

```sh
# Build fido-key-manager
cargo build --bin fido-key-manager

# Run fido-key-manager
./target/debug/fido-key-manager --help
```

On [Windows](#windows) (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Build fido-key-manager
cargo build --bin fido-key-manager

# Either:
# A) run Windows Terminal as Administrator, or,
Start-Process "shell:AppsFolder\$((Get-StartApps Terminal | Select-Object -First 1).AppId)" -Verb RunAs
# B) run PowerShell as Administrator.
Start-Process -FilePath "powershell" -Verb RunAs

# Run fido-key-manager from the Administrator terminal:
.\target\debug\fido-key-manager.exe --help
```

By default, Cargo will build `fido-key-manager` with the `nfc` and `usb`
[features][]. Additional features are described in `Cargo.toml` and in the
remainder of this document.

## Commands

Most `fido-key-manager` commands (except `info` and `factory-reset`) will
operate on the first *compatible* authenticator which:

* is in a connected NFC reader's field
* you press the button on an already-connected device
* is connected while `fido-key-manager` is running

This should fairly reliably mitigate accidental or unintentional selection, but
it's a good idea to have only **one** authenticator connected to your computer
when running `fido-key-manager`.

More information about the commands listed below can be seen by running
`fido-key-manager --help` or `fido-key-manager [command] --help`. Unless
otherwise specified below, all commands require an authenticator which supports
*at least* CTAP 2.0.

Command | Description | Requirements
------- | ----------- | ------------
`info` | get information about connected authenticators
`selection` | request user presence on a connected authenticator
`set-pin` | sets a PIN on an authenticator which doesn't already have a PIN set
`change-pin` | changes a PIN on an authenticator which has a PIN set
`factory-reset` | resets an authenticator to factory defaults, deleting all key material
`enable-enterprise-attestation` | enables the [Enterprise Attestation][] feature | CTAP 2.1
`set-pin-policy` | set a [Minimum PIN Length][] policy, or force a PIN change before next use | CTAP 2.1
`toggle-always-uv` | toggles the [Always Require User Verification][] feature | CTAP 2.1
`bio-info` | shows information about an authenticator's fingerprint sensor | CTAP 2.1-PRE, fingerprint sensor
`list-fingerprints` | lists enrolled fingerprints | CTAP 2.1-PRE, fingerprint sensor
`enroll-fingerprint` | enroll a new fingerprint | CTAP 2.1-PRE, fingerprint sensor
`rename-fingerprint` | renames an enrolled fingerprint | CTAP 2.1-PRE, fingerprint sensor
`remove-fingerprint` | removes an enrolled fingerprint | CTAP 2.1-PRE, fingerprint sensor
`get-credential-metadata` | gets discoverable credential storage metadata | CTAP 2.1-PRE, credential management
`list-credentials` | lists discoverable credentials | CTAP 2.1-PRE, credential management
`delete-credential` | deletes a discoverable credential | CTAP 2.1-PRE, credential management
`update-credential-user` | updates user information for a discoverable credential | CTAP 2.1, credential management

## Vendor-specific commands

**Warning:** for safety, ensure that you **only** have security key(s) from that
vendor connected to your computer when using **any** vendor-specific command,
**even benign ones**.

In the CTAP 2 protocol, vendor-specific command IDs can (and do!) have different
meanings on different vendors â€“ one vendor may use a certain ID as a safe
operation (such as "get info"), but another vendor might use the same ID to
start firmware updates, change the key's operating mode or perform some
potentially-destructive operation.

For operations that require multiple commands be sent to a security key, this
tool will attempt to stop early if a key reports that it does not support one
of the commands, or returns an unexpected value.

### SoloKey 2 / Trussed

> **Tip:** this functionality is only available when `fido-key-manager` is
> built with `--features solokey`.

SoloKey 2 / Trussed commands are currently **only** supported over USB HID. NFC
support may be added in future, but we have encountered many problems
communicating with SoloKey and Trussed devices *at all* over NFC, which has made
things difficult.

Command | Description
------- | -----------
`solo-key-info` | get all connected SoloKeys' unique ID, firmware version and secure boot status
`solo-key-random` | get some random bytes from a SoloKey

## Platform-specific notes

Bluetooth is currently disabled by default, as it's not particularly reliable on
anything but macOS, and can easily accidentally select nearby devices. It can be
enabled with `--features bluetooth`.

### Linux

* Bluetooth support isn't particularly reliable, and may require pairing in
  advance of using this tool.

* NFC support requires [PC/SC Lite][], and a PC/SC initiator (driver) for your
  NFC transceiver (reader).

  If you're using a transceiver with an NXP PN53x-series chipset (eg: ACS
  ACR122, Sony PaSoRi), you will need to block the `pn533` and `pn533_usb`
  kernel modules (which are incompatible [all other NFC software][linuxnfc])
  from loading:

  ```sh
  echo "blacklist pn533" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nfc.conf
  echo "blacklist pn533_usb" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nfc.conf
  sudo modprobe -r pn533
  sudo modprobe -r pn533_usb
  ```

  One of those `modprobe -r` commands will fail, depending on your kernel
  version.
  
  Finally, unplug and replug the transceiver.

  If issues return after you've rebooted your computer, you may *also* need to
  rebuild your initrd to pick up the `blacklist` entries above, and then reboot
  *again*.

* USB support requires `libudev` and appropriate permissions.

  systemd (udev) v252 and later
  [automatically tag USB HID FIDO tokens][udev-tag] and set permissions
  based on the `0xf1d0` usage page, which should work with any
  FIDO-compliant authenticator.

  Systems with older versions of systemd will need a "U2F rules" package
  (eg: `libu2f-udev`). But these match FIDO authenticators using a list of known
  USB manufacturer and product IDs, which can be a problem for new or esoteric
  authenticators.

### macOS

* Bluetooth support works fairly reliably, but automatic pairing could allow a
  nearby malicious device could open your computer up to long-term tracking over
  Bluetooth.

  It is not possible to pair a Bluetooth authenticator using `System Settings`,
  and instead programs need to pair it for you (which
  `webauthn-authenticator-rs` will do for you). However, it will try to pair
  *any* nearby authenticator, and some authenticators will stay online for
  several minutes after use.

* NFC should "just work", provided you've installed a PC/SC initiator
  (driver) for your transciever (if it is not supported by `libccid`).

  macOS tends to "butt in" on exclusive connections by selecting the PIV applet,
  which can cause issues for some keys' firmware, especially if they support
  PIV.

* USB should "just work".

### Windows

**Important:** This tool has only been tested with the *current builds* of
Windows 10 and 11 on 64-bit platforms (`arm64` and `x86_64`). This tool
(intentionally) does not support older versions of Windows, and is untested on
32-bit systems (it's 2023, come on).

**Windows 10** build 1903 and later (as well as **Windows 11**) block direct
communication with FIDO authenticators (or otherwise hide the USB devices), so
this tool *must* be run as `Administrator`.

This tool has been configured with [a manifest to run as Administrator][1],
which has some caveats:

* `cargo run` will not be able to run this program
* if elevation was necessary, it won't show the output of the tool in your
  current console window

Always run this tool from within a terminal running as Administrator.

You can disable the elevation manifest at build time with:

```powershell
$Env:RUSTFLAGS="--cfg disable_windows_manifest"
cargo build --bin fido-key-manager
```

But the program may not be usable anymore.

As long as you're running `fido-key-manager` as Administrator:

* Bluetooth support requires pairing in advance in `Settings`, and is not
  particularly reliable.

* NFC support should "just work", provided your transceiver supports the PC/SC 
  API.

* USB support should "just work".
